# Loops-JAVA-

The src code here is for Margarie's Gambling Addiction game. It intakes from the user how many quarters Margarie has, and how many times each machine has been played before Margarie starts playing. Each machine pays out after a set number of plays. The programs outputs the number of times Margarie can play given the user's input. This sample code shows competency of loops and algorithimic thinking.
